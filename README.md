# SQLServer

Disclaimer: For this project, I can't really upload any code files to the repository because they are part of a currently in-use service of the company where I work (as an intern)

The following documentation will be from a localhost website made with Radzen Blazor framework. The website is integrated to another database in the corporate server using SQL Sever Management Services (SSMS) and with support for SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) from my laptop ZENBOOK975.

What I did in this project is designing the printable PDF document using SQL Server Report Builder and making a button to show the preview of the PDF from Radzen Blazor Studio.
